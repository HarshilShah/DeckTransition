Currently, there is no way to specify options for the feedback in Objective-C, as the used Swift "OptionSet" type can not be exposed. The initializer is marked "@objc" and therefore exposing the options is not possible. As this initializer is marked "@objc", OptionSets can not be used as they can not be bridged into Objective-C. Due to this fact, the mentioned flag is introduced to provide a basic support for haptic feedback under Objective-C. If you are using Swift, please use ```DeckTransitioningDelegate.useHapticFeedback(at:)``` to configure the haptic feedback.
